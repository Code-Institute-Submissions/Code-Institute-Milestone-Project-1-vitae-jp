**INTRODUCTION**

---

This site is my first milestone project for my course provider - Code Institute. This website is an online fake persona resume with the goal not to be generic, to stand out and present all the information required in a creative way to my target audience - **Recruiters** and ultimately be hired.  

---

**UX Design** 

---
I found the following links from recruiters describing the best 35 personal websites ever viewed and the best resume format according to my target audience :

https://www.themuse.com/advice/the-35-best-personal-websites-weve-ever-seen
https://www.myperfectresume.com/how-to/2018-best-resume-formats-according-to-recruiters

I used this as a baseline to create my website's first wireframe (an example of the index page).

Through UX design process my website evolved and changed after reviews from my peers and mentor.  The biggest change to my website was an interview Code Institute had on SoundCloud with a recruiter, the recruiter (aka my target audience) spoke about images of an applicant being used.  I immediately removed images of the fake applicant and decided on a very minimal color scheme and eye catching Google fonts.  The interview is available here - https://soundcloud.com/codeinstitute/crafting-the-perfect-developer-cv.

An example of the index page after the interview of my target audience.

**Website Setup**

---

**Index/Home page** - Main title with animation, navigation bar underneath that with links to 3 pages and in the footer social links.

**Portfolio and reviews page** - Carousel with images of projects and reviews. Below in the footer- about me column, social links column, download CV pdf column. Header has title of page and a closing tab with tooltip which takes the user back to the Index/Home page. 

**Details page** - This is a resume page based on the information that is also available on the donwloadable CV.  The information is separated into accordions in 3 columns. The middle section is animation of the applicant's initials.  Below in the footer- about me column, social links column, download CV pdf column. Header has title of page and a closing tab with tooltip which takes the user back to the Index/Home page. 

**Contact me page** - An e-mail form to send a message to the applicant. This form is not connected to a server, I still have to learn how to do this in my course.  To deal with this I have added a modal to pop-up when the send button is clicked to notify the user the form is unavailable.  Below in the footer- about me column, social links column, download CV pdf column. Header has title of page and a closing tab with tooltip which takes the user back to the Index/Home page. 

**Note** - On mobile devices the footer only displays one of the columns on the Portfolio, Details and Contact me pages.  I have rotated them so the mobile user will read the about me, social links and download CV pdf, unlike the desktop user which sees all 3 columns displayed in the footer.

**Future features** - To connect a database to the form to receive messages from the users.
As I continue to learn about Full Stack Development, I want to create a separate page for coding, contributions, etc.
